  <h3>
    <p>An african-american rapper born in compton, california, Kendrick Lamar first started his career when he was 16. Back then he went by the name K-dot but change to Kendrick Lamar going by his first and middle name. In his music he makes sure to leave a trace of a black cultured feeling, really emphasizing his love for black empowerment. His latest work can is linked to the Black Panther film as he produced and inspired many songs on the soundtrack.</p>
    <p>For me, Kendrick Lamar is an inspirational person who always makes the user think to better themsekves and those around them. He's one of my favorite rappers and I would recommend him to anyone who enjoys music.
